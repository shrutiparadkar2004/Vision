People use blogs to connect with others, showcase their writing chops or share<br> their expertise. Eventually, some even figure out how to monetize a blog and make writing their full-time<br> job. These <span class="gap">blog templates</span> are helpful plug-and-play options, but you can also use them to spark your own<br> website design ideas.<br><br><br>
           The most common way to turn your blog into a money-making venture is to advertise.<br> Work with ad networks to display ads on your site so that when a visitor clicks on an ad, you earn a comm<br>ission. You can also earn money from referring visitors to other websites in a strategy called affiliate marketing.<br><br><br> 
            At the same time use keyword research to plan blog posts that can get you ranking on search engines<br>, generate traffic and increase your visibility to readers.
